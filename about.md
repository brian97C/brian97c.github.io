## About
My name is Brian Cronin. I am an MSc Pharmacy student at Trinity College, Dublin&#128300; I am primarily interested in healthcare, technology and business, but I enjoy reading widely in many other areas that I know a lot less about.

## Background
I was born in Cork, Ireland. When I was a child, I lived in San Diego, Cincinnati, and London before moving back to Ireland and undertaking secondary education in Athlone. Hopefully I picked up some American optimism and balanced it with Irish realism. In my spare time I have fun with endurance sports (Ex-rower, mainly running at the moment).
